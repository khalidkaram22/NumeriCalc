# 🧮 Numerical Methods Solver GUI

A modern, interactive Python application built using **Tkinter** that allows users to solve nonlinear and linear equations using a variety of **numerical methods**. This GUI-based tool is ideal for students, engineers, and educators needing quick and visual solutions for mathematical computations.

---

## 📌 Features

This app supports the following numerical methods:

### 🔢 Nonlinear Equation Solvers
- Bisection Method
- False Position Method
- Fixed Point Iteration
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Secant Method

### 🧠 Linear System Solvers
- Gaussian Elimination
- LU Decomposition
- Cramer’s Rule

Each method features:
- Clean, intuitive UI
- Error-tolerant input handling
- Live step-by-step iteration results in tables
- Elegant dark-themed styling with consistent design

---

## 🖼️ UI Preview

> Coming soon – Add screenshots or GIFs here to showcase each method's window.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- tkinter (comes built-in with most Python installations)
- numpy

### 🔧 Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
pip install numpy
\`\`\`

---

## ▶️ Running the App

\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

---

## 📘 Usage Guide

After launching the app:

1. Choose a numerical method from the main menu.
2. Fill in the required parameters (e.g., function, initial guesses, tolerance).
3. Click "Calculate" to view step-by-step iterations in a result table.
4. Click "← Back" to return to the main menu and choose another method.

## 💡 Examples

### Bisection Method
- Function: math.cos(x) - x
- Interval: xl = 0, xu = 1
- Tolerance: 0.0001

### LU Decomposition
- Input a 3x3 matrix A and vector b
- Displays both L and U matrices, and final solution X

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Support for symbolic input (using sympy)
- Plotting functions and convergence graphs
- Exporting results to CSV or PDF
- 4x4 or custom-sized matrix support
